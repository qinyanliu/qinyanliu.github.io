## English reading and writing
I am a big fan of English literature. Robert Frost's poems are my personal favourite.  
I am also an active member of USTC News Center, writing news reports on scientific research, school events, as well as interviews. If you want to see my published works, please click [here](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/ssjg.jsp?wbtreeid=1001) and search for my name "LIU Qinyan".

## Choral Singing
Currently I am an active member of USTC Student Chorus, singing as an alto and working as Head of Department of New Media Operations.

I have been interested in choral singing ever since I was a little child. Over the years I have been in different school chorus groups, and my knowledge and love for choral singing keep growing.  
## Sports
I enjoy playing badminton, swimming, jogging, and hiking with my friends.
